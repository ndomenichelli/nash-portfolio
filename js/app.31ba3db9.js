My main duties were converting old databases to new databases as we were converting everything to a new website. I was given the new database and its columns, or manually adding what new columns I was told we needed, and then looping through the old database programmatically, adding new rows in the new database with the old data, converting data as needed. I also made a front end for this function where I would select which old database to convert and how many rows to convert and other options. </p><p class="p"> Near the end of that job, I was also starting to work on an app for the company and was learning flutter and dart. I had time at work to learn how to create a signup/login page through firebase and also send and receive data through firebase as well. The app development was all done by me while the previous part of the job I was working with another developer remotely. </p><p class="p"> Other than web and app development, I have been enjoying learning game development and trying to learn Unity on my own as well. I have made proof of concept games and I am starting to learn how to make functional online multiplayer as well as some basic 3d modelling. Something else I recently completed was a website using technologies I learned either by myself or on the job to make a more interactive version of my resume as well as recording some videos to showcase some of my own projects. </p><p class="p"> The best way to contact me is through my email at <a href="mailto: ndomenichelli@gmail.com"> ndomenichell@gmail.com </a> and thanks for reviewing my cover letter and resume. </p>',5);function Z(e,t,o,n,i,a){return Y}var Q={name:"HelloWorld",props:{msg:String}};const X=(0,F.Z)(Q,[["render",Z]]);var $=X,ee={name:"App",components:{JobDescription:P,ProjectDescription:G,Intro:$},data(){return{showResume:!0}},methods:{toggleResume(){this.showResume=!this.showResume}}};const te=(0,F.Z)(ee,[["render",b]]);var oe=te;(0,n.ri)(oe).mount("#app")}},t={};function o(n){var i=t[n];if(void 0!==i)return i.exports;var a=t[n]={exports:{}};return e[n](a,a.exports,o),a.exports}o.m=e,function(){var e=[];o.O=function(t,n,i,a){if(!n){var s=1/0;for(c=0;c<e.length;c++){n=e[c][0],i=e[c][1],a=e[c][2];for(var r=!0,l=0;l<n.length;l++)(!1&a||s>=a)&&Object.keys(o.O).every((function(e){return o.O[e](n[l])}))?n.splice(l--,1):(r=!1,a<s&&(s=a));if(r){e.splice(c--,1);var d=i();void 0!==d&&(t=d)}}return t}a=a||0;for(var c=e.length;c>0&&e[c-1][2]>a;c--)e[c]=e[c-1];e[c]=[n,i,a]}}(),function(){o.d=function(e,t){for(var n in t)o.o(t,n)&&!o.o(e,n)&&Object.defineProperty(e,n,{enumerable:!0,get:t[n]})}}(),function(){o.g=function(){if("object"===typeof globalThis)return globalThis;try{return this||new Function("return this")()}catch(e){if("object"===typeof window)return window}}()}(),function(){o.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)}}(),function(){var e={143:0};o.O.j=function(t){return 0===e[t]};var t=function(t,n){var i,a,s=n[0],r=n[1],l=n[2],d=0;if(s.some((function(t){return 0!==e[t]}))){for(i in r)o.o(r,i)&&(o.m[i]=r[i]);if(l)var c=l(o)}for(t&&t(n);d<s.length;d++)a=s[d],o.o(e,a)&&e[a]&&e[a][0](),e[a]=0;return o.O(c)},n=self["webpackChunknash_portfolio"]=self["webpackChunknash_portfolio"]||[];n.forEach(t.bind(null,0)),n.push=t.bind(null,n.push.bind(n))}();var n=o.O(void 0,[998],(function(){return o(280)}));n=o.O(n)})();
